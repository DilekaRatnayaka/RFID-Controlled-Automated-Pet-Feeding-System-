## RFID-Controlled Automated Pet Feeding System

Welcome to the RFID-Controlled Automated Pet Feeding System repository! This project, developed as part of the PH 3037 Embedded Systems Laboratory at the University of Colombo, showcases an innovative application of embedded systems to enhance pet care. 

### Overview

RFID-Based Automated Pet Feeding System leverages cutting-edge technology to simplify and improve the pet feeding process. The system is designed to ensure that pets are fed in a timely and efficient manner, offering convenience and peace of mind to pet owners. Key features include:

- **RFID Technology:** Identifies and grants access to registered pets, ensuring that only the intended pet can access the food bowl.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Continuously monitor food levels in the bowl, with real-time data displayed on an LCD screen.
- **GSM Module:** Sends notifications to pet owners when the food level is low, prompting timely refills.
- **Servo Motor:** Controls the opening and closing of the food bowl lid, regulated by the ATmega32 microcontroller.

### Components Used

- **ATmega32 Microcontroller:** Central control unit for managing interactions between various components.
- **RFID RC522 Module:** Handles pet identification via RFID tags.
- **GSM SIM800L Module:** Facilitates remote communication to notify pet owners.
- **16x2 LCD Display:** Provides real-time visual feedback on food levels.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor:** Measures and monitors food levels in the container.
- **Servo Motor:** Operates the food bowlâ€™s lid to control access.

### Features

- **Automated Pet Feeding:** Ensures pets receive food even when owners are not home.
- **RFID-Based Access Control:** Customizable for multiple pets with unique dietary needs.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Ultrasonic sensors and LCD display keep owners informed about food levels.
- **Remote Notifications:** GSM module alerts owners when it's time to refill the food bowl.
- **Future Enhancements:** Potential for mobile app integration, data logging, and machine learning algorithms to personalize feeding schedules.

### Project Highlights

This project exemplifies the synergy between technology and pet care, offering a smart, secure, and user-friendly solution to pet feeding. The integration of RFID technology with real-time monitoring and remote communication showcases the potential of embedded systems to improve the lives of pets and their owners.

### Conclusion

The RFID-Controlled Automated Pet Feeding System not only ensures pets are properly nourished but also provides pet owners with real-time monitoring and peace of mind. With plans for further enhancements, this project holds promise for even more advanced and personalized pet care solutions.
